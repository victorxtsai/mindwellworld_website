            <h2 class="marginBottom">3. Security of Your Information</h2>
    
            <h3 class="marginBottom">3.1. Storing Your Data Locally</h3>
            <p>
                Data including your journal entries may be stored on your local device. Because it may be stored unencrypted locally, treat your device like a physical journal—do not misplace it or allow unauthorized access. Although a password or login may protect your account within the app, someone skilled may still be able to access unencrypted local files through third-party tools.
            </p>
    
            <h3 class="marginBottom">3.2. Transmitting Your Data to Servers</h3>
            <p>
                If and when data is sent to our servers (e.g., for backup or analysis), it is encrypted before transmission. This means that only encrypted data is transmitted, helping prevent third parties from intercepting and reading your data.
            </p>
    
            <h3 class="marginBottom">3.3. Storing Your Data on the Cloud</h3>
            <p>
                Data, including your journal entries, is stored in an encrypted format in our cloud environments (e.g., Firebase, Microsoft Azure). From time to time, we may decrypt your data in a secure environment to perform analytics (e.g., to power AI features or identify usage patterns) and for uses defined in Section 2. Access to decrypted data is strictly controlled, and only authorized personnel or systems can perform this operation.

        <!-- 5. Sharing Of Your Information -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="marginBottom">4. Sharing of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We only share your personal information under the circumstances described below:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>With Our Contracted Vendors, Service Providers, and Consultants:</strong>
                    We may share your personal information with companies that help us operate or improve our Service. This includes data hosting providers (e.g., Firebase, Microsoft Azure), payment processors, analytics tools, and security vendors. We only provide information to the extent necessary for them to perform their functions under appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>With AI/LLM Providers:</strong>
                    In order to deliver our chatbot features and personalized insights, we may use third-party large language model (LLM) services (e.g., OpenAI, Grok, or other platforms). Your user-generated content—such as journal entries, chatbot messages, and mood logs—may be shared as context with these AI providers so they can generate relevant responses and suggestions. We strive to limit the amount of personally identifiable information in these prompts and require that these providers maintain confidentiality and adhere to robust security measures. We do not grant these providers independent rights to use your information for purposes beyond assisting our Service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>In Connection with Business Transfers:</strong>
                    We may share or transfer your personal information as part of a potential or actual merger, acquisition, financing, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding involving the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. Where required by law, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any transfer of personal information to an unaffiliated third party.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>To Comply with Our Legal Obligations:</strong>
                    We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request. This can include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(i) complying with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas, or court orders;</li>
                        <li>(ii) protecting the rights, property, and safety of Mindwell World, our users, staff, or others;</li>
                        <li>(iii) enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of service;</li>
                        <li>(iv) responding to an emergency if we believe doing so is in good faith and required to protect personal safety.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>With Our Related Companies:</strong>
                    We may share personal information with our parent company, subsidiaries, or other affiliates where this is necessary for customer support, technical operations, or other uses consistent with this Privacy Policy. Any such sharing is subject to strict confidentiality and security requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                We may also create and share anonymized, aggregated, or de-identified usage data with our affiliated companies and third parties to help us analyze trends, gauge user engagement, or improve our Service. For example, we may publish aggregated insights (e.g., total number of users or how many people tracked their mood daily) that cannot be used to identify any individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> While we use AI and analytics tools to scan or process user data for personalization, our employees generally do not access or read personal data unless it is necessary for resolving technical issues, ensuring compliance with the law, or verifying the quality and safety of AI-generated recommendations. In such rare cases, we implement strict access controls and confidentiality protocols to safeguard your information.
